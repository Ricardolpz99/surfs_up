# # Surfs up
## Overview of Project
Hawaii is known for its tropical climate and its impressive beaches that year after year attract thousands of tourists, especially those who are surf enthusiasts. On a past trip to the island of Oahu, I was surprised by the island and decided to move to the island, to generate income I decided to start and open a surf and ice cream shop, for this a local investor interested in the project told me that the climate It is important for the store to be successful. Through a SQL database shared by our investor W. Avy, we seek to make an analysis of the average temperatures of the month of June and December
## Results
1- The results of the analysis showed that the average temperature between the months of June and December were 74.9 °F and 71 °F. 
 
 2- On the other hand the maximum temperatures between the two months ofJune and December were nearly the same too 86 °F and 83 °F..

 3- Finally the minimum temperatures were rather different in June and December 64 °F and 56 °F.

## Summary

Additionally, a comparative analysis of the precipitation during the months of June and December was made, in figure two it is seen that in the month of December there is more probability of rain, however this data does not increase too much compared to June. We believe that there is not much difference in weather during these months and that the temperatures are adequate to successfully open a surf and ice cream shop.
